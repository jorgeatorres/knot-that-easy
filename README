Knot-That-Easy is a program useful for getting information about mathematical knots (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Knot.html) by being able to actually "draw" a regular diagram of the knot inside the application.

Features
========
- It doesn't force you to use some sort of complicated knot codification system: you can enter a regular diagram of the knot using the mouse by drawing lines, creating over and under crossings, etc.
- It looks pretty nice compared to what is available right now on Linux and other platforms.
- Knot-That-Easy is written in Python using PyGTK+ for the UI so it should work across supported GTK+ platforms (Windows, OS X, Linux).
- Knot-That-Easy can determine the following data about a regular diagram of a knot:
    - # of crossings and arcs
    - alternance of the diagram
    - writhe
    - Gauss and Dowker codes
    - the Wirtinger presentation of the fundamental group of the knot
    - 3-colorability

Requirements
=============
- Python
- PyGTK+ (including Glade support)
